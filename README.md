Cyberpunk 2077 Night City Discord theme
==========

[![License][license-shield]][license-url] [![GitHub][github-shield]][github-url]

Cyberpunk2077 Night City inspired Vencord/BD theme for Discord.

The development of this is lively, and I do use it frequently, so I try to keep up with the latest Discord changes.
If you have any requests or note,s please do open an Issue or reach out to me.

## Installing
Note: Cyberpunk Theme only supports some plugins. If it is used by me, I probably will make adjustments to accommodate, but feel free to convince me to support more.

### For BD and Vencord:

Download the theme file the BetterDiscord Website or releases and move it into your injector's themes folder:

#### BetterDiscord: %appdata%\betterdiscord\themes
#### Vencord: %appdata%\vencord\themes
#### For using the theme online:

There are multiple ways to do this if your client offers using an online version. The suggested one for now is https://wosiu6.github.io/cyberpunk2077-discord-theme/main.css

For customizing the theme from there, you'll want to use custom css and add any variables you'd like to change. It should look something like this:
```css
:root {
	--main-color: red;
	--hover-color: yellow;
}
```
